=========

Welcome to the Mezzanine project. To learn more about Mezzanine please read 
the :doc:`overview` which contains a feature list, installation guide and 
other general information.

For more technical information about how content is managed, you can read 
about Mezzanine's :doc:`content-architecture` which describes the main 
components and how to extend them with your own custom content types. 

Template developers can read about how :doc:`themes` are used to skin a 
Mezzanine project. Mezzanine also comes with the ability for content authors 
to edit content directly within a page while viewing it on the website. 
You can read about this and how to implement it in templates under 
:doc:`inline-editing`.

Further reading includes information about Mezzanine's :doc:`search-engine`, 
a section on the :doc:`admin-customization` provided by Mezzanine, and a 
section on Mezzanine's :doc:`configuration` which outlines the various 
settings for configuring Mezzanine.

Lastly, you can learn about :doc:`blog-importing` into Mezzanine, or just 
browse the auto-generated docs for each of Mezzanine's :doc:`packages`.
